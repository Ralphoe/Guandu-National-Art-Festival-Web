              center of the earth.”
              <br />
              The land inside the nature park holds many memories, memories of
              nature, and mankind. The land never forgets.
              <br />
              Resonate with Earth is an attempt to call out to the land using
              human voices. As we listen to the sound of nature resonating from
              the hole, humans, like a playful child, may conduct a dialogue
              with the mother earth through primordial instincts.

            </h3>
            <p>
              Wind carries the seasonal changes onto a little adventure,
              delivering the concerto of nature. Bringing with it seeds,
              nutrients and hope to its destinations. The wind also symbolizes
              the continuation of life. Materials collected from nature are made
              into musical instruments. As we listen to the sounds they produce,
              we are listening to the wind’s journey. The wavy bamboo structure
              resembles rivers and other water bodies touched by the wind. It
              also symbolizes the past and present of Guandu.

              Be it the moment seeds germinate, the moment petals fall, or the
              moment of birth and death, sounds follow. The wetland species have
              been faithfully fulfilling their roles as orchestral members of
              the cycle of life. Erythrina variegata, from the family Fabaceae,
              is featured in this artwork. Arranged in a coiling manner, the
              space created symbolizes the cycle of the legume’s life.

                A cross-disciplinary artist who bases in Taipei and New York.
                She obtained her BFA from National Kaohsiung Normal University
                College of Fine Arts and her MFA in New Genres from San
                Francisco Art Institute. The narrating quality found in her work
                is a reflection of her interests in drama and literature. The
                objects and symbols, which are represented in symbolic gestures,
                embody the historical and cultural connotations. Tsai’s art is
                inspired by her own experience in life and conveys both personal
                and collective narratives. Tsai’s recent interactive works
                reflect her observations of the primitive and contemporary
                liturgies. She experiments with the physical properties of
                materials, connecting spirituality with materiality as well as
                the giving and receiving of senses in a concrete form. Her
                experience as an artist-in-residence led her to reach out to the
                community and initiate cross-disciplinary collaborations on
                “habitat projects” with various groups. She also founded
                Circuladium, a new media arts collective which creates sensory
                experiences through interactive technology.

                traditional Balinese percussion ensemble music. To further study
                this traditional form of music, he stayed in Bali for 6 years,
                and learned to speak Indonesian and Balinese. His musical

            "Gifts" play a special role in the lives of mankind. Unlike general
            functional needs, gifts always contain a nature of connection
            between the giver and the receiver, even if these objects called
            "gifts" are no different from general objects. This mutual
            relationship played a social function in early human life, meaning
            that it was not limited to individuals, but more often a
            responsibility and obligation between groups, or a kind of unspoken
            contractual relationship, also implying a certain moral and ethical
            value (the receiver has the duty and responsibility to give back).
            This is deeply expounded in the famous work of Marcel Mauss, the
            anthropologist: "The Gift: Forms and Functions of Exchange in
            Archaic Societies", which traces the role gifts played in primitive
            societies. This kind of exchange activity, detached from the
            functional aspect of bartering in early human society, gave objects
            more of a human psychological color. We always have countless
            reasons to give gifts to others (whether it's out of gratitude,
            admiration, or other motives). These objects always carry the
            intention (motivation) of the giver. In short, gifts contain the
            awareness and feelings of both the giver and the receiver, which
            create a connection between both sides. As a special object, gifts
            carry a certain spiritual significance due to this relationship they
            embody. Viewing nature as a gift means perceiving nature as
            something that is given to us. This perspective reflects how we
            think about our relationship with nature and how we can establish a
            connection through this relationship. With the advancement of
            civilization and technology, the idea of viewing nature as a
            resource to be controlled and managed is a commonly held ideology,
            with an attitude that is often utilitarian and instrumental.
            However, this attitude has gradually become controversial, with the
            emergence of various environmental issues such as global warming,
            climate change, and biodiversity, being wrapped up in the concept of
            Anthropocene. We are gradually realizing that nature is an organic
            system that operates as a whole (such as the Gaia hypothesis), which
            reminds us to rethink our relationship with nature. However, is
            there a more proactive attitude we can adopt towards our
            relationship with nature? If the theme of the previous exhibition, "
            Healing, A Methodology," helped us discover the spiritual
            connections and functions of nature, this year's curation, "Nature,
            A Gift," represents an opener attitude towards exploring these
            relationships. By placing artistic creation within the framework of
            gift-giving, we aim to foster a kind and profound connection with
            nature, just as what we do with the act of giving gifts.
